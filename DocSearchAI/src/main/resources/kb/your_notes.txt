Cloud Run is good for building microservices and AI agents because it scales automatically.
It works well for event-driven systems when combined with Pub/Sub or Cloud Scheduler.
Cloud Run supports concurrency, allowing multiple requests to be handled by a single instance.

For simple AI agents, you can keep the knowledge base in text files and deploy it in the container.
Gemini API can be used for embeddings and reasoning.

Best practices:
- Keep container images small.
- Use multi-stage Docker builds.
- Enable Cloud Run minimum instances for low-latency APIs.
- Use Secret Manager instead of environment variables for sensitive data.
- Add a /health endpoint.
- Log request info for debugging.

RAG works better if documents are short, clean, and well-structured.
Avoid dumping huge unstructured text; break content into small chunks.
