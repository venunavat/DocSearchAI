DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations.
Its goal is to shorten development cycles and deliver high-quality software continuously.

Continuous Integration (CI) means developers frequently merge code into a shared repository.
CI tools automatically build and test the application to detect issues early.

Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI by automating releases to staging or production environments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows provisioning infrastructure using configuration files.
Tools like Terraform, Cloud Deployment Manager, and Ansible are commonly used.

Monitoring is critical in DevOps. Popular tools include Prometheus, Grafana, and Cloud Monitoring.

Containers are widely used in DevOps for consistent deployment environments. Docker and Kubernetes are popular choices.
