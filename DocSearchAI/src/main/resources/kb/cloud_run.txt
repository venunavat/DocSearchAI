Cloud Run is a fullly managed serverless compute platform by Google Cloud.
It runs stateless containers without requiring servers, VMs, or Kubernetes.
Cloud Run automatically scales up on traffic and scales down to zero when idle.
It supports any language or framework because it runs your container as-is.
Pricing is based on request count, CPU, memory, and execution time.
Cloud Run services are publicly accessible by default, but you can restrict access using IAM.
It integrates natively with Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, and Cloud Logging.
Cold starts can be reduced using minimum instances.
You deploy by pushing a container image and running 'gcloud run deploy'.
